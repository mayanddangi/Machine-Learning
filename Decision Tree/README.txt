Overview
decision_tree.py contains the class which is used to build, fit, predict and plot decision tree. The decisionTree class has the following methods:

score(X, y): return accuracy of model
get_params: return max_depth, min_samples_split and criterion
set_params: to set the parameters
calculate_entropy(y): return entropy
calculate_infogain(X,y,feature, threshold): return information gain
_gini_index(y): return gini impurity
_find_best_split_ginni(X,y): return the best feature and threshold to split the data based on the Gini impurity.
bestFeature_ginni(X,y): return best feature and threshold(which is median of the label)
bestFeature_a(X,y): return best feature based on information gain
fit(self, train_data_path:str): Fit the decision tree to the binary training data X and y
predict(self, test_data_path:str): Predict the binary class labels for the input data X
growTree(X,y,depth): recursively grow tree
plot(): plot the decision tree using graphviz



Dependencies
This code requires the following dependencies:

numpy (for numerical operations)
matplotlib (for visualization)
graphviz (for visulaisation)
sklearn
pandas
time
os
sys
cv2 (reading image)
glob
tqdm

Usage
For binary classification use main_binary.py with following script 
python main_binary.py --train_path=./data/train --test_path=./data/test_sample --out_path=.

For multiclass classification use main_binary.py with following script 
python main_multi.py --train_path=./data/train --test_path=./data/test_sample --out_path=.

There are also two jupyter notebook seperate for multi and binary
