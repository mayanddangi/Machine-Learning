## Overview
**`svm_binary.py`** contains the Trainer class which is used to fit and predict binary classification problems using support vector machines (SVMs). The Trainer class has the following methods:

 - `fit(self, train_data_path:str)`: Fit the SVM model to the binary training data X and y using a specified regularization parameter C, kernel function kernel, and maximum number of iterations max_iter. This method returns the trained SVM model.
 - `predict(self, test_data_path:str)`: Predict the binary class labels for the input data X using the trained SVM model model. This method returns a 1D array of predicted binary class labels.

dditionally, there are two helper functions `fit_multi()` and `predict_multi()` which are used by the `svm_multiclass.py` script to train and predict on the multi-class classification problems by combining binary classifiers.

**`svm_multiclass`** contains two classifier, One-vs-One and One-vs-All. Each of them have two functions `fit()` and `predict()` having same signature.

**`kernel.py`** contains the function to calculate kernel matrix.
supported kernel are:
 - Linear
 - Polynomial
 - RBF
 - Sigmoid
 - Laplacian


## Dependencies
This code requires the following dependencies:

 - numpy (for numerical operations)
 - matplotlib (for visualization)
 - qpsolver (for solving dual problem)
 - pandas (for reading data frame)

## Usage
To use the Trainer class for binary classification, import the Trainer class from **`svm_binary.py`** and create an instance of it. Then, call the `fit()` method to fit the SVM model to the training data and the `predict()` method to predict the binary class labels for new data.
